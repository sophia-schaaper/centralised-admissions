BOUND	1669	1669	1	AN	The boundary change indicator is a classification of changes in an education agency's boundaries since the last report to NCES.  The options are: 1 = No change since last report. 2 = Education agency has closed with no effect on another agency’s boundaries, but was open with dropout counts in one of the three previous years. 3 = This is a new education agency formed with no effect on another agency's boundaries. 4 = Agency was in existence, but not reported on previous year's CCD agency universe, and is now being added. 5 = Agency has undergone a significant change in geographical boundaries or instructional responsibility.
